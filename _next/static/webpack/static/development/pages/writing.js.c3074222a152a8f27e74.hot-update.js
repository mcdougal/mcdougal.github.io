Afloat\nOn the surface\nOf surf serene and\nSo calm,\nStreaming in sunlight,\nHumming along.\nThe motor tugs\nForward, the wake\nSlips behind,\nSleep settles over\nThis nook as this mind\nMeanders, a river\nOf thoughts\nWinding through\nThe depths of a dream,\nAdrift on the blue.\n    "

Go softly sneaking,\nAs the walls are slowly weakening.\nAlarming thoughts from people seeking\nQuestions with another meaning.\n\nJolted soul; erupting head \u2013\nCan't remember what was said \u2013\nTo Life I was so shortly wed:\nAnd now I must get out of bed.\n    "

Not yet, not quite.\nThis void's becoming rather trite.\n\nFor to survive you must invite\nThe morbid fact that naught\u2019s alright.\n    "
