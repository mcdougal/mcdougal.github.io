  abstract: "\nData retrieved through computer-driven quantitative textual analysis of Beatles lyrics was combined with data retrieved from computer-driven quantitative auditory analysis of Beatles music in order to build an extensive dataset that can answer a wide variety of multi-dimensional questions. This dataset spans the Beatles' career and provides metrics such as danceability, energy, positive emotions, negative emotions, self-referential lyrics, big words, etc. It can be indexed by year, album, songwriter, chart position, and\nmore. This study explores a number of general relationships and trends within the data in order to best demonstrate the types of questions that can be answered with this dataset.\n    ".trim(),

  abstract: "\nThe vast amount of digital data in the world has led many companies to adopt distributed computing. However, this is not a perfect solution. Eric Brewer's CAP Theorem outlines a few of the limitations inherent in distributed computing. This paper explores current efforts to overcome these limitations. First, I introduce and explain the CAP Theorem. Then, I examine modern strategies for addressing the CAP Theorem limitations. Finally, I conclude the paper by summarizing my findings, explaining limitations in my research, and ruminating on the future of distributed computing.\n    ".trim(),
