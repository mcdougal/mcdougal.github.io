This dataset spans the Beatles' career and provides metrics such as danceability, energy, positive emotions, negative emotions, self-referential lyrics, big words, etc. It can be indexed by year, album, songwriter, chart position, and\nmore. This study explores a number of general relationships and trends within the data in order to best demonstrate the types of questions that can be answered with this dataset.\n    `.trim(),\n    href: `https://cedricmcdougal.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/personal-site/docs/computer-driven-analysis-of-the-music-and-lyrics-of-the-beatles.pdf`,\n  },\n  {\n    title:\n      `Overcoming the CAP Theorem: A survey of research on ` +\n      `distributed computing`,\n    abstract: `\nThe vast amount of digital data in the world has led many companies to adopt distributed computing. However, this is not a perfect solution. Eric Brewer's CAP Theorem outlines a few of the limitations inherent in distributed computing. This paper explores current efforts to overcome these limitations. First, I introduce and explain the CAP Theorem. Then, I examine modern strategies for addressing the CAP Theorem limitations. Finally, I conclude the paper by summarizing my findings, explaining limitations in my research, and ruminating on the future of distributed computing.\n    `.trim(),\n    href: `https://cedricmcdougal.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/personal-site/docs/overcoming-the-cap-theorem-a-survey-of-research-on-distributed-computing.pdf`,\n  },\n];\n"],"mappings":";;;;;;;;;;AAAA;AAAA;AAEA;AAEA;AAGA;AAIA;AARA;AAWA;AAGA;AAGA;AAPA;;;;A","sourceRoot":""}
