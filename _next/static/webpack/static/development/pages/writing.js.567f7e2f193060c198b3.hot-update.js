  abstract: "\nData retrieved through computer-driven quantitative textual analysis of Beatles lyrics was combined with data retrieved from computer-driven quantitative auditory analysis of Beatles music in order to build an extensive dataset that can answer a wide variety of multi-dimensional questions. This dataset spans the Beatles' career and provides metrics such as danceability, energy, positive emotions, negative emotions, self-referential lyrics, big words, etc. It can be indexed by year, album, songwriter, chart position, and\nmore. This study explores a number of general relationships and trends within the data in order to best demonstrate the types of questions that can be answered with this dataset.\n    ".trim(),

  abstract: "\nThe vast amount of digital data in the\nworld has led many companies to adopt distributed\ncomputing. However, this is not a perfect solution.\nEric Brewer's CAP Theorem outlines a few of the\nlimitations inherent in distributed computing. This\npaper explores current efforts to overcome these\nlimitations. First, I introduce and explain the CAP\nTheorem. Then, I examine modern strategies for\naddressing the CAP Theorem limitations. Finally, I\nconclude the paper by summarizing my findings,\nexplaining limitations in my research, and\nruminating on the future of distributed computing.\n    ",
